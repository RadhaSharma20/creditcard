AIM: credit card fraud detection

Objective: High Accuracy: Develop models that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives to ensure genuine transactions are not mistakenly flagged.
Real-time Detection: Implement algorithms that can analyze transactions in real-time, allowing for immediate action upon detecting potential fraud.
Scalability: Build a system that can handle large volumes of transactions efficiently, scaling with the growth of the user base and transaction volume.
Adaptability: Create models that can adapt to evolving fraud patterns and techniques by continuously learning from new data.
Interpretability: Ensure that the models provide insights into why a transaction is flagged as fraudulent, aiding in understanding the decision-making process and enabling fraud analysts to make informed decisions.
Feature Engineering: Identify and engineer relevant features from transaction data that can improve the detection accuracy of the models.
Model Explainability: Utilize interpretable machine learning techniques to explain the decision-making process of the models, enhancing trust and transparency.
Efficiency: Develop models that are computationally efficient, allowing for fast processing of transactions without compromising accuracy.
Robustness: Design the system to be resilient against adversarial attacks and attempts to bypass fraud detection measures.
Compliance: Ensure that the system complies with relevant regulations and standards governing the handling of sensitive financial data and the implementation of fraud detection measures.
